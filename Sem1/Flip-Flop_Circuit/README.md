# 🔁 Flip-Flop Circuit Project

This project demonstrates a **transistor-based flip-flop circuit** that controls two LEDs blinking alternately while generating a pulsing sound from a buzzer.  
It is powered by a **9V battery** and built using **S9013 transistors**, **RC timing components**, and **potentiometers** for adjustable speed.

## ⚙️ How It Works
The flip-flop circuit operates as an **astable multivibrator**, where both transistors alternately switch ON and OFF:

- When **Transistor Q1** is ON → LED1 lights up while LED2 is OFF.  
- When **Q1 turns OFF** and **Q2 turns ON** → LED2 lights up while LED1 turns OFF.  
- The **buzzer** produces a pulsing tone in sync with the LEDs.  
- **Potentiometers** allow speed adjustment by varying the capacitor charge/discharge rate.
