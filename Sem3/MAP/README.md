# 🖥️ MAP 201 & 202 (HMI Project)

This project integrates **PLC programming** and **Human Machine Interface (HMI)** to create a simple **industrial automation control system**.  
It demonstrates real-time monitoring and process control using **CX-Programmer** and an **HMI panel**, representing communication between a controller and operator interface.

## 🖼️ Project Overview
This project consists of two main parts:
1. **MAP201** – PLC logic programming using **Ladder Diagram** for automation sequences.  
2. **MAP202** – HMI interface design for visual feedback and manual control.

The system simulates a **tank filling process**, **temperature control**, and **motor operation** that can be monitored and controlled via HMI.
