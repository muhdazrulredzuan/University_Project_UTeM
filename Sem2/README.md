## 🧩 Project List

### 🔢 [Synchronous Abnormal Counter](./Synchronous_Abnormal_Counter)
A fully simulated **digital counter** designed using **JK Flip-Flops** in **Multisim**.  
The counter follows a custom sequence and uses switches to trigger clock pulses and transitions between states.

📂 Includes: `report.pdf`, `file.ms14` (Multisim)  
🧠 Focus: Sequential logic, JK Flip-Flop, synchronous design.

### 🌐 [Network Planning Design (RIPv2)](./Network_Design_RIPv2)
A **Cisco Packet Tracer** network design implementing **RIPv2 routing protocol**.  
Routers are configured for dynamic route exchange and connectivity verification using `show ip route` and `ping` commands.

📂 Includes: `report.pdf`, `file.pkt` (Cisco Packet Tracer)  
🧠 Focus: Routing configuration, RIPv2 setup, network simulation.

### 🚌 [Real-Time Campus Bus Monitoring System](./UTeM_Bus_Monitoring_System)
A **Python-based project** that tracks and displays bus routes, schedules, and real-time updates within UTeM.  
Developed using **Visual Studio Code**, integrating **data visualization** and **timing logic**.

📂 Includes: `report.pdf`, `source code` folder  
🧠 Focus: Python programming, real-time data handling, system design.
